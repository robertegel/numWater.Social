View [concept.pdf](https://github.com/robertegel/numWater.Social/blob/master/concept.pdf) for more information about the models behavior.
This project is built on a previous unpublished group project which developed a complex numeric model simulating a water supply systems behavior with multiple processes.
While this project considers social aspects of such a system, it's [sibling](https://github.com/robertegel/numWater.Stochastic) cares about uncertain amounts of rainfall.
