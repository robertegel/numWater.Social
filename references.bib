  abstract = {Knowing the survival rates of water-borne Escherichia coli is important in evaluating microbial contamination and making appropriate management decisions. E. coli survival rates are dependent on temperature, a dependency that is routinely expressed using an analogue of the Q10 model. This suggestion was made 34 years ago based on 20 survival curves taken from published literature, but has not been revisited since then. The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the accuracy of the Q10 equation, utilizing data accumulated since 1978. We assembled a database of 450 E. coli survival datasets from 70 peerreviewed papers. We then focused on the 170 curves taken from experiments that were performed in the laboratory under dark conditions to exclude the effects of sunlight and other field factors that could cause additional variability in results. All datasets were tabulated dependencies “log concentration vs. time.” There were three major patterns of inactivation: about half of the datasets had a section of fast log-linear inactivation followed by a section of slow log-linear inactivation; about a quarter of the datasets had a lag period followed by log-linear inactivation; and the remaining quarter were approximately linear throughout. First-order inactivation rate constants were calculated from the linear sections of all survival curves and the data grouped by water sources, including waters of agricultural origin, pristine water sources, groundwater and wells, lakes and reservoirs, rivers and streams, estuaries and seawater, and wastewater. Dependency of E. coli inactivation rates on temperature varied among the water sources. There was a significant difference in inactivation rate values at the reference temperature between rivers and agricultural waters, wastewaters and agricultural waters, rivers and lakes, and wastewater and lakes. At specific sites, the Q10 equation was more accurate in rivers and coastal waters than in lakes making the value of the Q10 coefficient appear to be site-specific. Results of this work indicate possible sources of uncertainty to be accounted for in watershed-scale microbial water quality modeling.},

  abstract = {Behavior is normally described as altruistic when it is motivated by adesire to benefit someone other than oneself for that person’ssake. The term is used as the contrary of“self-interested” or “selfish” or“egoistic”—words applied to behavior that ismotivated solely by the desire to benefit oneself.“Malicious” designates an even greater contrast: itapplies to behavior that expresses a desire to harm others simply forthe sake of harming them., Sometimes, however, the word is used more broadly to refer to behaviorthat benefits others, regardless of its motive. Altruism in this broadsense might be attributed to certain kinds of non-humananimals—mother bears, for example, who protect their cubs fromattack, and in doing so put their own lives in danger. So used, thereis no implication that such adult bears act “for the sake”of their young (Sober and Wilson 1998: 6). , This essay will discuss altruism in the former sense, as behaviorundertaken deliberately to help someone other than the agent for thatother individual’s sake. There is a large and growing empiricalliterature on altruism, which asks whether there is an evolutionary orbiological basis for human altruism, and whethernon-human species exhibit it or something similar to it.These issues are addressed by the entries on empirical approaches to altruism and biological altruism., It is commonly assumed that we ought to be altruistic at least to someextent. But to what extent? And is altruism necessarily admirable? Whyshould one act for the sake of others and not only forone’s own sake? For that matter, do people in fact outof altruism, or is all behavior ultimately self-interested?}
